            When you invite Eliza in a guild we may store the guild's id and the id of each member.<span class="tiny-br"></span>
            When voice recognition is enabled, we may process voice data in order to provide speech-based commands.<br>
            Such data and the related transcripts never get stored nor leave our services as we do not rely on third-party services to analyze speech.
