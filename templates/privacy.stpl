            <small>
              When you invite Eliza in a guild we may store the guild's id and the id of each member.<br>
              When voice recognition is enabled, we may process voice data in order to provide speech-based commands.
              Such data and the related transcripts never get stored nor leave our services as we do not rely on third-party services to analyze speech.
            </small>

          <div id="how-we-use-your-information" class="privacy-section">
            <h5 class="privacy-section__title">How we use your information</h5>
            <small>
              Your information is used to ensure the proper functioning of our services.<br>
              We take privacy very seriously, and therefore we don't share any of your information with third parties.<br>

            <h5 class="privacy-section__title">How we protect your information</h5>
            <small>
              Whenever your information leaves one of our servers it is encrypted.

          <div id="how-long-we-keep-your-information" class="privacy-section">
            <h5 class="privacy-section__title">How long we keep your information</h5>
            <small>
              Any information is retained for as long as it's needed for the purposes for which we collected it.<br>
              Whenever Eliza loses access to some information (e.g. when a member leaves a guild), such information gets deleted from our storage.
